# Horiseon


## Description

- I  did this project in order to refactor code that was given to me. 
- The project helped to solve the broken links and condense the CSS style sheet.
- I learned how to use anchor tags to create hyperlinks, creating different headers, and using classes to group items together. This also hepled me better understand HTML, CSS, and how to use GitHub.
